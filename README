StealthOverlay - a World of Warcraft (1.12.1) AddOn
===================================================

Installation:

Put "StealthOverlay" folder into ".../World of Warcraft/Interface/AddOns/".
Create AddOns folder if necessary

Features:
- slowly dims your screen when you enter Stealth
- allows you to quickly notice that you have been kicked out of Stealth
- makes cof- Ok, this one is a lie. It doesn't make any coffee, yet.

Known Issues:
- Doesn't make coffee
- the "/stealth" slash command sometimes will freeze your client
- At the moment AddOnn doesn't check if you're a Rogue, expect weird shit playing any other class that has stances (Warrior, Druid, Your mo-)

Thanks to:
- the guy that make exactly same addon for TBC with same or very similar name (somewhere on curse.com - now I'm unable to find it, hence why I wrote my own)
